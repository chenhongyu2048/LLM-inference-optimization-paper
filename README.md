# LLM-inference-optimization-paper

# Summary of some awesome works for optimizing  LLM inference    

This summary will including three parts: 
1. some **repositories** that you can follow
2. some representative **person** or **labs** that you can follow
3. some important **works** in the different research interests

## Repositories
For example, [LLMSys-PaperList](https://github.com/AmberLJC/LLMSys-PaperList) contains many excellent articles, and is keeping updating (which I believe is the most important for a paperlist).   
[Awesome-LLM-Inference](https://github.com/DefTruth/Awesome-LLM-Inference) is also worth reading.    

Besides, [awesome-AI-system](https://github.com/lambda7xx/awesome-AI-system) works also very well. And you can find other repositories in its content.  

The log ["Large Transformer Model Inference Optimization"](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-01-10-inference-optimization/) helps me a lot at the beginning.

#### Dataflow

I'd like to create a separate area for data flows. It's just my preference.
