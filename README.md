# LLM-inference-optimization-paper
Summary of some awesome works for optimizing  LLM inference

This summary will including three parts: 
1. some **repositories** that you can follow
2. some representative **person** or **labs** that you can follow
3. some important **works** in the different research interests

## Repositories
For example, [LLMSys-PaperList](https://github.com/AmberLJC/LLMSys-PaperList) contains many excellent articles, and is keeping updating (which I believe is the most important for a paperlist).  

Besides, [awesome-AI-system](https://github.com/lambda7xx/awesome-AI-system) works also very well. And you can find other repositories in its content.  

## Person/Lab

**Follow others' research, and find yourself's idea.**  

It is not my intention to judge the work of these pioneers, and I understand that the shortness of my knowledge will lead me to leave out many important people.   
If you have a different opinion, please feel free to communicate with me through the issue.  
**In no particular order!!**
